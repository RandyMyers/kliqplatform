REST Admin API reference
The Admin API lets you build apps and integrations that extend and enhance the Shopify admin.

Some newer platform features may only be available in GraphQL.

Anchor to Client librariesClient libraries
Use Shopify’s officially supported libraries to build fast, reliable apps with the programming languages and frameworks you already know.

Use the curl utility to make API queries directly from the command line.

# See http://curl.se/docs/install.html for more details.
Anchor to AuthenticationAuthentication
All REST Admin API queries require a valid Shopify access token.

Public and custom apps created in the Partner Dashboard generate tokens using OAuth, and custom apps made in the Shopify admin are authenticated in the Shopify admin. To simplify the authentication process, use one of the recommended Shopify client libraries.

Include your token as a X-Shopify-Access-Token header on all API queries. Using Shopify’s supported client libraries can simplify this process.

To keep the platform secure, apps need to request specific access scopes during the install process. Only request as much data access as your app needs to work.

Anchor to Endpoints and requestsEndpoints and requests
Admin REST API endpoints are organized by resource type. You’ll need to use different endpoints depending on your app’s requirements.

All Admin REST API endpoints follow this pattern:

https://{store_name}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-07/{resource}.json

Create a new product.

This example illustrates how to create a new product using the Product resource and the /admin/api/2025-07/products.json endpoint. Replace {store_name} with your store’s domain and {access_token} with the access token you generated in the Authentication section.

The Admin API is versioned, with new releases four times per year. To keep your app stable, make sure you specify a supported version in the URL. Learn more about API versioning.

All REST endpoints support cursor-based pagination. All requests produce HTTP response status codes.

Learn more about API usage.

Anchor to Rate limitsRate limits
The REST Admin API supports a limit of 40 requests per app per store per minute. This allotment replenishes at a rate of 2 requests per second. The rate limit is increased by a factor of 10 for Shopify Plus stores.

Anchor to Usage limitationsUsage limitations
REST Admin API supports a limit of 40 requests per app per store per minute.

Past the limit, the API will return a 429 Too Many Requests error.

All REST API responses include the X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit header, which shows how many requests the client has made, and the total number allowed per minute.

A 429 response will also include a Retry-After header with the number of seconds to wait until retrying your query.

Anchor to Status and error codesStatus and error codes
All API queries return HTTP status codes that can tell you more about the response.

Anchor to [object Object]401 Unauthorized
The client doesn’t have correct authentication credentials.

Anchor to [object Object]402 Payment Required
The shop is frozen. The shop owner will need to pay the outstanding balance to unfreeze the shop.

Anchor to [object Object]403 Forbidden
The server is refusing to respond. This is typically caused by incorrect access scopes.

Anchor to [object Object]404 Not Found
The requested resource was not found but could be available again in the future.

Anchor to [object Object]422 Unprocessable Entity
The request body contains semantic errors. This is typically caused by incorrect formatting, omitting required fields, or logical errors such as initiating a checkout for an out-of-stock product.

Anchor to [object Object]429 Too Many Requests
The client has exceeded the rate limit.

Anchor to [object Object]5xx Errors
An internal error occurred in Shopify. Check out the Shopify status page for more information.

AccessScope
The AccessScope resource allows you to retrieve the permissions that a merchant has granted to an app, such as read_orders and write_products. These permissions allow apps to access data from a shop, and are granted when a merchant installs the app or updates an existing installation of the app.

The list of access scopes retrieved is based on the access token for the request. It returns only those access scopes that are associated with the token.

For more information about access scopes, see the access scopes API reference.

Note
If your app is already installed on a shop and you want the merchant to grant additional access scopes, you need to redirect the merchant to the app install page with the additional requested scopes. After a merchant installs the updated app, any subsequent calls made to the AccessScope resource will return the updated list of granted access scopes.

ApplicationCharge
The ApplicationCharge resource facilitates one-time charges. This type of charge is recommended for apps that aren’t billed on a recurring basis. You can create an application charge by sending a request with the name the charge should appear under, the price your app is charging, and a return URL where Shopify redirects the merchant after the charge is accepted. After you've created the charge, redirect the merchant to the confirmation URL returned by Shopify. If the charge is declined, then Shopify redirects the merchant and provides a notification message that the app charge was declined.

Note
For testing purposes you can include "test": true when creating the charge. This prevents the credit card from being charged. Test shops and demo shops can't be charged.

ApplicationCredit
Important
Creating application credits through this resource is being deprecated. App credits can continue to be created using the appCreditCreate mutation in the Partner API.

The ApplicationCredit resource is used to issue credits to merchants that can be used towards future app purchases in Shopify. You can create an application credit by sending a request that includes the credit amount and a description explaining the reason for the credit. A corresponding deduction based on your revenue share is entered in your Partner account by Shopify. For example, if you create a credit for $10.00, then a deduction of $8.00 is applied.

The total amount of all application credits requested by an app must not exceed the total amount the shop owner was charged in the last 30 days, or the total amount of pending payouts in the app's Partner account.

Note
The ApplicationCredit resource can be used only by apps that use Shopify's Billing API (ApplicationCharge, RecurringApplicationCharge, or UsageCharge).

RecurringApplicationCharge
The RecurringApplicationCharge resource facilitates a fixed-value, 30-day recurring charge. You can create an application charge by sending a request with the name the charge should appear under, the price your app is charging, and a return URL where Shopify redirects the merchant after the charge is accepted. After you've created the charge, redirect the merchant to the confirmation URL returned by Shopify. If the charge is declined, then Shopify redirects the merchant and provides a notification message that the app charge was declined.

Note
For testing purposes you can include "test": true when creating the charge. This prevents the credit card from being charged. Test shops and demo shops cannot be charged.

Updating an application charge
Each shop can have only one recurring charge per app. When a new recurring application charge is activated for a shop that already has one, the existing recurring charge is canceled and replaced by the new charge. The new recurring charge is then activated.

For example, if you want to offer discounted pricing to a specific merchant, then you can create a new application charge for the shop. This will prompt the shop to accept the new charge in order to continue using the app. The new charge replaces the old billing going forward.

UsageCharge
You can use the UsageCharge resource to add variable usage fees to an existing recurring application charge. You can use these resources to support billing plans that vary from month to month, with or without a monthly recurring fee.

Creating usage charges
To use the UsageCharge resource, first create a recurring application charge. This returns the ID that you'll need to create an associated usage charge.

To create the usage charge, send a POST request, where {id} represents the ID of the previously created recurring application charge.


POST
/admin/recurring_application_charges/{id}/usage_charges.json
Charging for usage only
A common billing scenario is to charge only usage-based fees, without a flat recurring monthly fee. To charge only usage-based fees without a recurring monthly fee, first create a recurring application charge with a price of $0.00 and then apply the usage charge.

You need to include the capped_amount and terms properties in the body of your request when you create a recurring application charge with a price of $0.00.

Setting capped amounts
You can use the RecurringApplicationCharge resource to specify a capped amount that applies to usage-based billing. This prevents the customer from being charged for any usage over and above the capped amount. To implement capped amount billing, create a recurring application charge with the capped dollar amount, and then create the associated usage charge.


Note
The capped amount setting is applicable on a per billing cycle basis (30 days), and remains in effect unless updated.

For step-by-step guidance that walks through this flow using examples, see our implementation guide.

Customer
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Requires access to protected customer data.
The Customer resource stores information about a shop's customers, such as their contact details, their order history, and whether they've agreed to receive email marketing.


The Customer resource also holds information on the status of a customer's account. Customers with accounts save time at checkout when they're logged in because they don't need to enter their contact information. You can use the Customer API to check whether a customer has an active account, and then invite them to create one if they don't.

For security reasons, the Customer resource doesn't store credit card information. Customers always need to enter this information at checkout.

In a shop's checkout settings, there are three options for customer accounts:

Accounts are disabled: Customers can't create accounts and can check out only as guests.
Accounts are optional: Customers have the choice of either signing into their account or checking out as a guest. Customers can create accounts for themselves, and the shop owner can create an account for a customer and then invite them by email to use it.
Accounts are required: Customers can't check out unless they're logged in, and the shop owner must create their accounts.
Caution: Only use this data if it is necessary for the intended app functionality. Shopify retains the ability to restrict access to API Access scopes for apps not requiring legitimate use of the associated data.

post
Creates an account activation URL for a customer

customerGenerateAccountActivationUrl
Requires customers access scope.
Generate an account activation URL for a customer whose account is not yet enabled. This is useful when you've imported a large number of customers and want to send them activation emails all at once. Using this approach, you'll need to generate and send the activation emails yourself.

The account activation URL generated by this endpoint is for one-time use and will expire after 30 days. If you make a new POST request to this endpoint, then a new URL will be generated. The new URL will be again valid for 30 days, but the previous URL will no longer be valid.

DiscountCode
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Note
We recommend using the GraphQL Admin API to manage discounts. The Discount types available in the GraphQL Admin API are intended to replace the GraphQL Admin PriceRule object and REST Admin PriceRule and DiscountCode resources.

You can use the PriceRule DiscountCode resource to create discount codes that enable specific discounts to be redeemed. Merchants can distribute discount codes to their customers using a variety of means, such as an email or URL, and customers can apply these codes at checkout.

Each discount code belongs to a price rule, which holds the logic for the discount. For more information, see the PriceRule resource.

To create multiple discount codes that use the same price rule logic, use the batch endpoint. For example, you might allow merchants to create a batch of discount codes that belong to the same price rule but are each personalized for a different customer.

discountRedeemCodeBulkAdd
Creates a discount code creation job.

The batch endpoint can be used to asynchronously create up to 100 discount codes in a single request. It enqueues and returns a discount_code_creation object that can be monitored for completion. You can enqueue a single creation job per a shop and you can't enqueue more until the job completes.

The price_rule_id path parameter is the ID of the price rule that the discount code will belong to. This is required because each discount code must belong to a price rule.

Response fields that are specific to the batch endpoint include:

status: The state of the discount code creation job. Possible values are:
queued: The job is acknowledged, but not started.
running: The job is in process.
completed: The job has finished.
codes_count: The number of discount codes to create.
imported_count: The number of discount codes created successfully.
failed_count: The number of discount codes that were not created successfully. Unsuccessful attempts will retry up to three times.
logs: A report that specifies when no discount codes were created because the provided data was invalid. Example responses:
"Price rule target selection can't be blank"
"Price rule allocation method can't be blank"

PriceRule
Requires price_rules access scope.
Note
We recommend using the GraphQL Admin API to manage discounts. The Discount types available in the GraphQL Admin API are intended to replace the GraphQL Admin PriceRule object and REST Admin PriceRule and DiscountCode resources.

You can use the PriceRule resource to create discounts using conditions. You can then associate the conditions with a discount code by using the DiscountCode resource. Merchants can distribute the discount codes to their customers.

Using the PriceRule resource, you can create discounts that specify a discount as a percentage, a fixed amount, or free shipping. You use entitlements and prerequisites to dynamically build these discounts.

To learn about how to associate a price rule with a discount code, see the DiscountCode resource.

Create a price rule
You can create price rules with entitlements and prerequisites. Entitlements describe the designated resources that a discount applies to, such as specific products, variants, or collections. Prerequisites describe the requirements that must be met in order for the discount to apply to the entitled resources. For example, you might want a discount to apply only to a certain shipping price range, or a certain subtotal range.

You can use entitlements, prereqisites, and other conditions to create discounts, such as the following examples:

$10 off the buyer's order if the total exceeds $40
15% off certain collections
free shipping on orders over $100.00 for Canadian buyers, redeemable up to 20 times
For examples of how to create price rules, see the POST method.

Gift Card
Requires gift_cards access scope.
Note
You need to contact Shopify Support to request the write_gift_cards and read_gift_cards access scopes.

A gift card is an alternative payment method. Each gift card has a unique code that is entered during checkout. Its balance can be redeemed over multiple checkouts. Optionally, a gift card can assigned to a specific customer. Gift card codes cannot be retrieved after they're created—only the last four characters can be retrieved.

You can use the GiftCard resource to create, retrieve, and update gift cards for a store. After a gift card is created, only the expiry date, note, and template suffix can be updated.

Note
You can't delete gift cards, but you can disable them. You can't enable gift cards that were previously disabled.

InventoryItem
Requires inventory access scope.
An inventory item represents a physical good. It holds essential information about the physical good, including its SKU and whether its inventory is tracked.

There is a 1:1 relationship between a product variant and an inventory item. Each product variant includes the ID of its related inventory item. You can use the inventory item ID to query the InventoryLevel resource to retrieve the location and quantity for an inventory item.

Use the InventoryItem resource together with the InventoryLevel and Location resources to manage a store's inventory across multiple locations.

InventoryLevel
Requires inventory access scope.
An inventory level represents the quantities of an inventory item for a location.

Each inventory level belongs to one inventory item and has one location. For every location where an inventory item can be stocked, there's an inventory level that represents the inventory item's quantities relating to that location.


Before you begin updating inventory, it's helpful to understand the relationships between the inventory resources:

Product Variant: Contains merchandising information, such as price, description, and images. Think of this as the product information that you might want a customer to see.
All product variants have a 1:1 relationship with their associated inventory item. Each product variant has one inventory item, and that inventory item belongs only to that product variant.

InventoryItem: Contains information about the physical product, such as its SKU. Think of this as the back-end information used for managing inventory, shipping, and fulfillments.
Inventory items are associated with one or many inventory levels. An inventory item will have an inventory level for each location where the item is stocked.

InventoryLevel: Represents the actual quantity of an item that is available.
Inventory levels connect one inventory item to one location. Each inventory level holds the available quantity for its inventory item at the associated location.

Location: Represents a geographical location where a merchant does business, such as a retail store or warehouse.
Locations can have many inventory levels. Each location has one inventory level for each inventory item that the location stocks.

How an order affects inventory
When a product variant that Shopify tracks is included in an order, Shopify decrements the inventory for that variant. Shopify doesn't know which location the item will be fulfilled from, so Shopify decrements the inventory level at the location that has the lowest ID.

Note
Orders placed through Shopify POS are associated with the location where the sale was made. For those orders, inventory is decremented at that location.
When an order is fulfilled, the fulfillment includes the ID of the location where the fulfillment is taking place. Shopify checks whether the fulfillment location matches the original location where stock was decremented, and then adjusts the inventory if necessary:

If the fulfillment location matches the original location, then no action is needed.
If the fulfillment location doesn't match the original location, then Shopify decrements the inventory level at the fulfillment location and increments the inventory level at the original location.
Example: Inventory adjustments for a simple order
An online store uses two warehouses to stock product inventory: one in Los Angeles (ID: 6884556842), and one in New York (ID: 13968834616). One of the store's products is a hat that's stocked at both locations with the following inventory levels:

Los Angeles: 8
New York: 6
A customer places an order for a hat. The Los Angeles location has the lowest ID, so Shopify decrements the item's inventory level at that location:

Los Angeles: 7
New York: 6
The order is actually fulfilled from the New York location. When the fulfillment is created, it includes the ID for the New York location. Shopify compares the fulfillment location ID to the original location and finds that they're different. Shopify then increments the inventory level at the Los Angeles location, and decrements the inventory level at the New York location:

Los Angeles: 8
New York: 5
Inventory levels and fulfillment service locations
A fulfillment service location has a 1:1 relationship with a third-party fulfillment service. When an app creates a new fulfillment service on a store, Shopify automatically creates a location that's associated with that fulfillment service. The FulfillmentService resource has a location_id property, which identifies the associated location.

An inventory item connected to a fulfillment service location can't be connected to any other locations at the same time:


Connecting an inventory item to a fulfillment service location
When you work with items that have been or will be connected a fulfillment location, you should include "relocate_if_necessary": true in the body of the request. There are two situations where you might do this:

connecting an inventory item to a fulfillment service location and disconnecting it from all standard locations
connecting an inventory item to one or more standard locations and disconnecting it from a fulfillment service location
If relocate_if_necessary is true, then all inventory for the item is relocated to the new location and disconnected from any other locations. If a fulfillment service location is involved but relocate_if_necessary is false, then the connection will fail. If no fulfillment service is involved, then the property is ignored and no inventory is relocated.

Setting the inventory level at a fulfillment service location
When you set inventory for a location, the inventory item is connected to the location if they are not already connected. If the item has been or will be connected to a fulfillment service location, then you should include "disconnect_if_necessary": true in the body of the request. There are two situations where you might do this:

setting inventory for an inventory item at a fulfillment service location when the item is already connected to one or more standard locations
setting inventory for an inventory item at a standard location when the item is already connected to a fulfillment service location
The inventory at the new location is set to the value of the available property. The inventory for other locations is set to 0 and the locations are disconnected from the inventory item.

If disconnect_if_necessary is set to false when you set inventory at a location and a fulfillment service location is involved, then the action will fail. If no fulfillment service location is involved, then this property is ignored.

MarketingEvent
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Marketing events represent actions taken by your app, on behalf of the merchant, to market products, collections, discounts, pages, blog posts, and other features. These actions target multiple potential customers, rather than specific individuals. For example, you should model your marketing event at the email campaign level, rather than on a per-email basis.

Merchants get value from marketing events because they help them understand sales and traffic attribution. Implementing marketing events for your app is beneficial because it enables Shopify to surface your app in the Shopify admin in ways that are helpful to merchants. Examples of marketing events include an ad campaign that drives multiple potential customers to a product page, or an email marketing campaign advertising a discount code.

Marketing events can be created for email campaigns, affiliate links, advertisements, and other common marketing tactics. Marketing events include the event_type and marketing_channel properties that help Shopify to rank your app and surface it in the Shopify admin in ways that are useful to merchants. Traffic and order attribution for your app is handled by providing UTM parameters with your marketing events. The same UTM parameters are also used in the links provided in the marketing event.

Engagements can also be added to marketing events to give merchants more insight into how potential customers interact with your marketing events. For example, engagements for ad campaigns can include clicks, shares, and comments. Creating engagements is optional, and not all marketing events include engagements.

Creates a marketing event

marketingActivityCreateExternal
Requires marketing_events access scope.
Marketing events can be created to track ad campaigns that target a specific time of year. For example, a marketing event can be created to track a Facebook ad campaign for Christmas 2022. When creating the marketing event, the body of the request includes the UTM parameters that must be included in the links provided in the marketing event. Each marketing event also includes the event_type and marketing_channel properties that help Shopify to rank your app and surface it within Shopify admin.


After a marketing event is created in Shopify, you can start to drive traffic to Shopify. Make sure that the links for the marketing event contain the same UTM parameters that were defined in the marketing event. For example, marketing activities for the Christmas 2022 ad campaign would use the following URL convention:


https://storename.com/product?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Christmas2022-12142018

post
Creates marketing engagements on a marketing event

marketingEngagementCreate
Engagements on marketing events represent customer activity taken on the marketing event before customers reach the shop’s website. Not all types of marketing events will necessarily have engagement, and most types of marketing events will only use a subset of the possible engagement types.


Engagements are aggregated on a daily basis. However, the data can be sent more often than once a day if the information is available. If you create an engagement with the same value for occurred_on as an existing engagement, then the new engagement will overwrite the previous one.

Anchor to Parameters of Creates marketing engagements on a marketing eventParameters
api_version
string
required
marketing_event_id
string
required
occurred_on
required
The date that these engagements occurred on, in the format “YYYY-MM-DD”.

ad_spend
The total ad spend for the day, if the marketing event is a paid ad with a daily spend.

clicks_count
The total number of clicks on the marketing event for the day.

comments_count
The total number of comments for the day.

favorites_count
The total number of favorites for the day.

impressions_count
The total number of impressions for the day. An impression occurs when the marketing event is served to a customer, either as a email or through a marketing channel.

is_cumulative
Whether the engagements are reported as lifetime values rather than daily totals.

shares_count
The total number of shares for the day.

views_count
The total number of views for the day. A view occurs when a customer reads the marketing event that was served to them, for example, if the customer opens the email or spends time looking at a Facebook post.

Metafield
Metafields are a flexible way to attach additional information to a Shopify resource (e.g. Product, Collection, etc.). Some examples of data stored using metafields include specifications, size charts, downloadable documents, release dates, images, or part numbers. Metafields are identified by an owner resource, a namespace, and a key and they store a value along with type information for that context.

Resources that can have metafields
Article

MobilePlatformApplication
Requires mobile_platform_applications access scope.
Note
Please contact Shopify Support to enable this scope for your app

You can use the MobilePlatformApplication resource to enable shared web credentials for Shopify iOS apps, as well as to create iOS universal link or Android app link verification endpoints for merchant Shopify iOS or Android apps. Shared web credentials let iOS users access a native app after logging into the respective website in Safari without re-entering their username and password. If a user changes their credentials in the app, then those changes are reflected in Safari. You must use a custom domain to integrate shared web credentials with Shopify. With each platform's link system, users can tap a link to a shop's website and get seamlessly redirected to a merchant's installed app without going through a browser or manually selecting an app.

For full configuration instructions on iOS shared web credentials, see the associated domains setup technical documentation.

For full configuration instructions on iOS universal links or Android App Links, see the respective iOS universal link or Android app link technical documentation.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

DraftOrder
Requires draft_orders access scope.
Requires access to protected customer data.
Merchants can use draft orders to create orders on behalf of their customers. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:

Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.
Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't displayed in a shop's inventory.
Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
Take pre-orders.
Note
The Draft Order resource doesn't expose reserve inventory information.

Caution: Only use this data if it is necessary for the intended app functionality. Shopify retains the ability to restrict access to API Access scopes for apps not requiring legitimate use of the associated data.

Using the DraftOrder resource you can create orders in draft state using product variant line items, or custom line items. To create a product variant draft order, provide the variant_id, quantity and discount properties. To create a custom line item, provide the title, price, taxable, and quantity properties.

Note
If you are using this endpoint with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can only create five draft orders per minute.

Polling
When you create and update draft orders some calculations are done asynchronously, such as calculating shipping and taxes. There might be times when a draft order is created but these calculations haven't completed. In these cases, you need to poll the draft order until the calculations are finished. When a draft order requires polling, a 202 accepted response code is returned along with location and retry-after response headers. The location header refers to the URL to be polled, and retry-after denotes the interval (in seconds) at which polling requests should be sent. When the draft order is ready, a 200 OK response code will be returned.
About custom shipping lines
You can use the DraftOrder resource to send orders with custom shipping lines. A custom shipping line includes a title and price with handle set to Nil. A shipping line with a carrier provided shipping rate (currently set via the Shopify admin) includes the shipping rate handle.
Applying discounts
A draft order and its line items can have one discount each. Calculations for discounts are based on the setting of the value_type property, which can be set to either fixed_amount or percentage. For example, you can apply a fixed amount discount to a draft order to reduce the price by the specified value property. When you use a percentage discount, the discount amount property is the price multiplied by the value property. For line item discounts, the value property is applied per individual unit of the item, based on the line item's quantity.

Calculating line item discount amounts

For fixed_amount discounts, the total amount corresponds to the line item quantity times the value of the discount. For percentage discounts, the total amount corresponds to the following:

amount = floor(price * quantity * value) / 100, where floor() is the usual round down function.

For non-fractional currencies, this formula needs to use round() instead of floor(), and the division by 100 takes place inside the rounding, resulting in a non-fractional value. Otherwise, an error is returned.

amount = round(price * quantity * value / 100)

Line item examples
Fixed amount discount

For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with $5 dollars off, discount amount corresponds to $10 ($5 * 2):

applied_discount: { "value_type": "fixed_amount", "value": 5, "amount": 10 }

Percentage discount

For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with 15% off, discount amount corresponds to $5.99 (floor ($19.99 * 2 * 15) / 100):

applied_discount: { "value_type": "percentage", "value": 15, "amount": 5.99 }

Loading and removing customers
You can load a customer to a draft order by sending the customer_id as part of the draft order resource. We recommend removing a customer from a draft order by making a POST request with the Customer resource set to null, without specifying an email, shipping address, or billing address. A customer can also be removed by setting customer, email, shipping_address, and billing_address to null.

draftOrderUpdate
Updates a draft order.

All non read-only properties of the DraftOrder Resource can be edited.

Caution
If a checkout has been started for a draft order, any update to the draft will unlink the checkout. Checkouts are created but not immediately completed when opening the merchant credit card modal in the admin, and when a buyer opens the invoice URL. This is usually fine, but there is an edge case where a checkout is in progress and the draft is updated before the checkout completes. This will not interfere with the checkout and order creation, but if the link from draft to checkout is broken the draft will remain open even after the order is created.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Order
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Requires access to protected customer data.
An order is a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a shop. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete orders using the Order resource.

Usage notes

When you create an order through the API, no payment information is collected, and no transaction is performed.
After an order is created, you can change only a few of its attributes using the API. You can't change the items or the quantities in an order using the REST API, but you can change them using the GraphQL Admin API.
You can add metafields to the Order resource.
You can allow merchants to create orders manually by using the DraftOrder resource.
Caution
You can't use the Order resource to create a new checkout for an individual store. To create a checkout, you need to use the Checkout API or an SDK powered by the Storefront API, such as the JavaScript Buy SDK, iOS Buy SDK, or Android Buy SDK.

Caution
Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the Order resource by default. If you want to access older orders, then you need to request access to all orders. If your app is granted access, then you can add the read_all_orders scope to your app along with read_orders or write_orders.

Only use this data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict access to scopes for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Order Risk
Requires orders access scope.
The Order Risk resource allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete order risks. Order risks represent the results of fraud checks that have been completed for an order.

Usage notes
Caution
As of version 2024-04 this resource is deprecated. Risk Assessments can be queried via the Order Risk Assessment API.

This resource is deprecated in version 2024-04. Please refer to the GraphQL api for Order#field-order-risk
When determining an order's risk level, Shopify takes into account only those order risks that have the display property set to true. Orders with a display set to false will not be returned through the Order Risk resource. It's not advised to create order risks with a display set to false. This property might be removed in future API versions.
Risk assessments will favor the most severe risk recommendation for an order. Keep this in mind when creating new order risks.

Properties
cause_cancel
->

recommendation
Whether this order risk is severe enough to force the cancellation of the order. If true, then this order risk is included in the Order canceled message that's shown on the details page of the canceled order.

Note: Setting this property to true does not cancel the order. Use this property only if your app automatically cancels the order using the Order resource. If your app doesn't automatically cancel orders based on order risks, then leave this property set to false.

checkout_id
deprecated
The ID of the checkout that the order risk belongs to.

display
deprecated
Whether the order risk is displayed on the order details page in the Shopify admin. If false, then this order risk is ignored when Shopify determines your app's overall risk level for the order.

It's not advised to create order risks with a display set to false.

Note
This property can't be changed after an order risk is created.

This property might be removed in future API versions.
id
deprecated
A unique numeric identifier for the order risk.

merchant_message
deprecated
The message that's displayed to the merchant to indicate the results of the fraud check. The message is displayed only if display is set totrue.

message
->

description
The message that's displayed to the merchant to indicate the results of the fraud check. The message is displayed only if display is set totrue.

order_id
->

id
The ID of the order that the order risk belongs to.

recommendation
->

recommendation
The recommended action given to the merchant. Valid values:

Show recommendation properties
score
string
->

riskLevel
For internal use only. A number between 0 and 1 that's assigned to the order. The closer the score is to 1, the more likely it is that the order is fraudulent.

Note
There is no guarantee of stability in risk scores. Scores are not probabilities. The relationship between scores and the probability of fraud can vary over time and between risk providers.

source
->

provider
The source of the order risk.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Refund
Requires ANY of the following access scopes: orders, marketplace_orders.
The Refund resource has two major components:

Transaction records of money returned to the customer
The line items included in the refund, along with restocking instructions
Before you create a refund, use the calculate endpoint to generate accurate refund transactions. Specify the line items that are being refunded, their quantity and restock instructions, and whether you're refunding shipping costs. You can then use the response of the calculate endpoint to create the actual refund.

When you create a refund using the response from the calculate endpoint, you can set additional options, such as whether to notify the customer of the refund. You can refund less than the calculated amount for either shipping or the line items by setting a custom value for the amount property.

If a refund includes shipping costs, or if you choose to refund line items for less than their calculated amount, then an order adjustment is created automatically to account for the discrepancy in the store's financial reports.

order
Caution
For multi-currency orders, the currency property is required whenever the amount property is provided.

Calculates refund transactions based on line items and shipping. When you want to create a refund, you should first use the calculate endpoint to generate accurate refund transactions. Specify the line items that are being refunded, their quantity and restock instructions, and whether you intend to refund shipping costs. If the restock instructions can't be met—for example, because you try to return more items than have been fulfilled—then the endpoint returns modified restock instructions. You can then use the response in the body of the request to create the actual refund.

The response includes a transactions object with "kind": "suggested_refund", which must to be changed to "kind" : "refund" for the refund to be accepted.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Transaction
Requires ANY of the following access scopes: orders, marketplace_orders.
Transactions are created for every order that results in an exchange of money.


There are five types of transactions:

Authorization: An amount reserved against the cardholder's funding source. Money does not change hands until the authorization is captured.
Sale: An authorization and capture performed together in a single step.
Capture: A transfer of the money that was reserved during the authorization stage.
Void: A cancellation of a pending authorization or capture.
Refund: A partial or full return of captured funds to the cardholder. A refund can happen only after a capture is processed.
Refund transactions must be created by using the Refund resource.

Note
An order can have more than one authorization transaction associated with it. This might happen when an order is edited or when a post-purchase upsell is added to the order. To be notified when an order is edited subscribe to the OrderEdit webhook.

If your app captures payments, you should make a GET request to the /admin/api/{version}/orders/{order_id}/transactions.json endpoint to retrieve the authorization transactions associated with an order. Then, to complete the full order payment capture, you should use the authorization or parent_id properties in separate capture POST requests to the same endpoint for each authorization transaction.

Note
An order can have no more than 100 transactions associated with it.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

User
Requires users access scope.
Shopify Plus
The User resource is available for private apps and custom apps installed on Shopify Plus stores. You need to contact Shopify Plus Support to request the read_users access scope for your app.

The User resource lets you retrieve information about staff on a Shopify shop, including staff permissions.

Permissions determine the level of access that staff have to a merchant's store. From the Shopify admin, merchants can give each staff individual permissions that control access to a part of Shopify. The API only lets you retrieve information about staff.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Collect
Requires products access scope.
The Collect resource connects a product to a custom collection.


Collects are meant for managing the relationship between products and custom collections. For every product in a custom collection there is a collect that tracks the ID of both the product and the custom collection. A product can be in more than one collection, and will have a collect connecting it to each collection. Unlike many Shopify resources, collects aren't apparent to store owners.

Collects are for placing products in custom collections only. Smart collections use rules to determine which products are their members. Creating a collect that links a product to a smart collection results in a 403 Forbidden error.

For more information on custom collections, see the CustomCollection resource.

Collection
Requires products access scope.
A collection is a grouping of products that merchants can create to make their stores easier to browse. For example, a merchant might create a collection for a specific type of product that they sell, such as Footwear. Merchants can create collections by selecting products individually or by defining rules that automatically determine whether products are included.

Shopify stores start with a single collection, called Frontpage. This is a collection of products that are shown on the front page of the online store.

There are two different types of collection:

Custom collections, which contain products that are manually added to a collection by a merchant. For more information, see the CustomCollection resource.
Smart collections, which contain products that are automatically added based on selection conditions that a merchant chooses. For more information, see the SmartCollection resource.
The Collect resource is used to connect a product to a custom collection.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Collection
Requires products access scope.
A collection is a grouping of products that merchants can create to make their stores easier to browse. For example, a merchant might create a collection for a specific type of product that they sell, such as Footwear. Merchants can create collections by selecting products individually or by defining rules that automatically determine whether products are included.

Shopify stores start with a single collection, called Frontpage. This is a collection of products that are shown on the front page of the online store.

There are two different types of collection:

Custom collections, which contain products that are manually added to a collection by a merchant. For more information, see the CustomCollection resource.
Smart collections, which contain products that are automatically added based on selection conditions that a merchant chooses. For more information, see the SmartCollection resource.
The Collect resource is used to connect a product to a custom collection.

CustomCollection
Requires products access scope.
A custom collection is a grouping of products that a merchant can create to make their store easier to browse. The merchant creates a custom collection and then selects the products that will go into it.


Collections are typically displayed to customers so that buyers can select to view only the products in the collection. Shopify stores start with a single custom collection called frontpage—the collection of products shown on the front page of the online store.

The Collect resource is used to connect a product to a custom collection.

There are also smart collections, which contain products based on selection conditions rather than because they've been included manually. For more information, see the SmartCollection resource.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Product Image
Requires products access scope.
Important
Listing, creating, updating, and deleting product images is deprecated as of REST API 2025-01. For more information, refer to the guide to the new product model.

Products are easier to sell if customers can see pictures of them, which is why there are product images.


Any product may have up to 250 images, and images can be in .png, .gif or .jpg format.

Best practices for naming image files

To successfully upload or update images, follow these best practices when naming your image files:

Don't use spaces in the file name. Example: my file name.png
Don't begin your file name with symbols, like "!". Example: !my_file_name.png
Avoid using periods before the file extension. Example: my_file_name..png
Avoid long, complicated file names that contain excess characters.
Example: my_---_file_---_name_---.png

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Product Variant
Requires products access scope.
Important
Listing, creating, updating, and deleting product variants is deprecated as of REST API 2024-04. For more information, refer to the guide to the new product model.

Important
Apps can no longer set inventory using inventory_quantity. For more information, refer to the Inventory Level resource.

A variant can be added to a Product resource to represent one version of a product with several options. The Product resource will have a variant for every possible combination of its options. Each product can have a maximum of three options and a maximum of 100 variants.

The original price of the item before an adjustment or a sale.

created_at
->

createdAt
The date and time (ISO 8601 format) when the product variant was created.

fulfillmentService
The handle of a fulfillment service that stocks a product variant.

This is the handle of a third-party fulfillment service if the following conditions are met:

The product variant is stocked by a single fulfillment service.
The FulfillmentService is a third-party fulfillment service. Third-party fulfillment services don't have a handle with the value manual.
The fulfillment service hasn't opted into SKU sharing.
If the conditions aren't met, then this is manual.
The relationship between a product variant and a fulfillment service was changed in the 2022-07 API version. A ProductVariant can be stocked by multiple fulfillment services. As a result, we recommend that you use the InventoryLevel resource if you need to determine where a product variant is stocked.

If you previously set this field, then we recommend that you instead connect an inventory item to a location. Each Location is associated with a single FulfillmentService. The value of this field after setting it will be as described above.

If you need to determine whether a product is a gift card, then you should continue to use this field until an alternative is available.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

SmartCollection
Requires products access scope.
A smart collection is a grouping of products defined by rules that are set by the merchant. Shopify automatically changes the contents of a smart collection based on the rules. Smart collections, like other types of collections, are used to break down the catalog of products into categories and make the shop easier to browse.

By default, a store can have up to 5000 smart collections.

The Collect resource is used to connect a product to a smart collection. However, these collects can't be added or removed from the API as they're managed by the rules of the smart collection.


You can use the CustomCollection resource to work with collections where each product in the collection is manually chosen by the merchant.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Checkout
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Requires access to protected customer data.
Important
The REST Checkout API is deprecated as of version 2024-07. Please see the developer changelog for more information.

If you're building an app with the Sales Channel SDK, then you can use the Checkout API to let customers purchase products from Shopify stores that have installed your sales channel.

Shopify uses the Checkout resource to manage a user's cart as it transitions to a paid order. This process includes specifying which line items are included in the checkout, attaching a customer's shipping and payment details, and calculating tax and shipping rates. Credit card payments can be attached to a Checkout using the Payment resource.

Note
You can't use the Checkout API to create a new checkout user experience for an individual store. For that you need to use an SDK that's powered by the Storefront API instead, such as the JavaScript Buy, iOS Buy, and Android Buy SDKs.

Retrieves a list of available shipping rates for the specified checkout. Implementers need to poll this endpoint until rates become available.

Each shipping rate contains the checkout's new subtotal price, total tax, and total price in the event that this shipping rate is selected. This can be used to update the UI without performing further API requests.
To apply a shipping rate, update the checkout's shipping line with the handle of the selected rate.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

CollectionListing
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
A CollectionListing resource represents a product collection that a merchant has made available to your sales channel. Merchants can make collections available to your sales channel directly from their Shopify admin.

You can use this resource to retrieve collections that a merchant has published and display them in your marketplace. You can also retrieve a list of published product IDs that belong to a published collection.

Only sales channels can publish collections using the REST Admin API. You can't publish collections and make them available to non-sales channels apps using the REST Admin API.

Note:
When a merchant makes a collection available to your app, the products belonging to that collection are not automatically made available. The merchant must make both the collection and each product available to your sales channel.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Payment
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Requires access to protected customer data.
Note
Sales channels require elevated permissions to interact with the Payment resource. For more information, see the Request Payment Processing section on the Start building a sales channel app page.

The Payment resource allows sales channels to build a fully native checkout experience by submitting a customer's payment details directly to Shopify.

To complete a payment using the Payment resource, first create a payment session by submitting the card details to Shopify's card vault in exchange for a session ID. The session ID can then be used to create a payment for an existing Checkout.

The Payment resource is compatible only with direct payment gateways. For a list of all supported payment gateways, see Direct and external credit card payment providers.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Product ResourceFeedback
Requires resource_feedbacks access scope.

Important
Product ResourceFeedback is only for use with the Sales Channel SDK.

The Product ResourceFeedback API allows you to communicate the state of a shop's individual products, as it pertains to your application, by sending product feedback within the Shopify admin. Once created, product resource feedback is used help merchants get your app setup on their store by addressing missing steps or fixing problems.
Send product feedback
You can send feedback on a product to let merchants know what steps they need to take to make sure your app is set up correctly. Feedback can have one of two states: requires_action or success. You will need to send a requires_action feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete. If there are multiple setup steps requiring merchant action, send feedback with a state of requires_action as merchants complete prior steps. Send a success feedback request to remove the feedback message from Shopify admin.

Important
Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the Shop. Unlike REST-style APIs, you don't need to make a PATCH or PUT request to update any previously sent feedback. Send a new POST request to push the latest state of a shop or its resources to Shopify.

Formatting the resource feedback message field
If your state is requires_action you can send up to ten string messages, which communicate the action to be taken by the merchant. Each string must be a single message up to 100 characters long, must start with a capital letter (but not use all caps), and must end with a period. You must adhere to the message formatting rules or your requests will fail:

Examples:

Needs at least one image.
Needs to be a shippable product.
Merchants viewing individual products will see your app's messages as a bulleted list of errors. Other user interfaces in Shopify admin will report statistics like the number of errors your app has reported. Once the merchant has made a single or a series of updates to validate the product, your app can send a status ofsuccess.

Type: ISO 8601 UTC DateTime as string with year, month [or week], day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and time zone.

Note
If you queue a Feedback API payload for delivery at a later time, do not update this value when the API call is actually made; ensure that the current time is set when building the payload.

resource_updated_at
->

productUpdatedAt
The forwarded updated_at timestamp of the product. Used only for versioned resources, where the updated_at timestamp changes based on merchant actions. When required, it is used along with feedback_generated_at to help determine whether incoming feedback is outdated compared to feedback already received, and if it should be ignored upon arrival.

ProductListing
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
A ProductListing resource represents a Product which is available to your sales channel. Merchants can make products available to your sales channel directly from their Shopify admin.

You can use this resource to retrieve products that a merchant has published and display them to customers in your marketplace for sale.

A ProductListing resource itself is unable to have its attributes modified directly. The attributes of a ProductListing are inherited from the Product resource to which it is associated. Therefore, all attributes of a ProductListing should be considered read-only.

A product can have one of the following statuses: active, draft, or archived. Draft and archived are considered non-active statuses. If you create a listing for a non-active product, then the product won't be published immediately. You must change the product status to active to make the product available on a sales channel.

If the product is sold exclusively on subscription, then you can create a listing for the product only on an online store.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

ResourceFeedback
Requires resource_feedbacks access scope.
The ResourceFeedback resource lets your app report the status of shops and their resources. For example, if your app is a marketplace channel, then you can use resource feedback to alert merchants that they need to connect their marketplace account by signing in.

Resource feedback notifications are displayed to the merchant on the home screen of their Shopify admin, and in the product details view for any products that are published to your app.

This resource should be used only in cases where you're describing steps that a merchant is required to complete. If your app offers optional or promotional set-up steps, or if it makes recommendations, then don't use resource feedback to let merchants know about them.

Sending feedback on a shop
You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can have one of two states: requires_action or success. You need to send a requires_action feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.

If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send feedback with a state of requires_action as merchants complete prior steps. And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a success feedback request.

Important
Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the Shop. Unlike REST-style APIs, you don't need to make a PATCH or PUT request to update any previously sent feedback. Send a new POST request to push the latest state of a shop or its resources to Shopify.

Formatting the resource feedback message field
If the feedback state is requires_action, then you can send a string message that communicates the action to be taken by the merchant.

The string must be a single message up to 100 characters long and must end with a period. You need to adhere to the message formatting rules or your requests will fail:

[Explanation of the problem]. [Suggested action].

Examples:

[Your app name] is not connected. Connect your account to use this sales channel. [Learn more]
[Your app name] is not configured. Agree to the terms and conditions to use this app. [Learn more]

Both Your app name and Learn more (a button which directs merchants to your app) are automatically populated in the Shopify admin.

Setting feedback permissions
Add the write_resource_feedbacks permission to your requested scopes.

messages
A concise set of copy strings to be displayed to merchants, to guide them in resolving problems your app encounters when trying to make use of their Shop and its resources.

Required only when state is requires_action. Disallowed when state is success.

Content restrictions for Shop feedback: one message up to 100 characters long.

feedback_generated_at
->

feedbackGeneratedAt
The time at which the payload is constructed. Used to help determine whether incoming feedback is outdated compared to feedback already received, and if it should be ignored upon arrival. Type: ISO 8601 UTC datetime as string with year, month [or week], day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and time zone.

Note
If you queue a Feedback API payload for delivery at a later time, do not update this value when the API call is actually made; ensure that the current time is set when building the payload.

AssignedFulfillmentOrder
Requires assigned_fulfillment_orders access scope.
A list of all the fulfillment orders that are assigned to an app at the shop level. The list of fulfillment orders can be filtered by location and assignment status.

Assigned fulfillment orders are fulfillment orders that are set to be fulfilled from locations managed by fulfillment services that are registered by the app. One app (api_client) may host multiple fulfillment services on a shop. Each fulfillment service manages a dedicated location on a shop. Assigned fulfillment orders can have associated fulfillment requests or might currently not be requested to be fulfilled.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

CancellationRequest
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
The CancellationRequest resource represents a cancellation request made by the merchant or an order management app to a fulfillment service for a fulfillment order. A fulfillment service can accept or reject the cancellation request.

Retrieving cancellation request details
The FulfillmentOrder resource and the merchant_requests field can be used to retrieve the merchant requests which have been made. The overall status of these requests is also available using the request_status field of the fulfillment order.

To learn more about the cancellation request process in the fulfillment workflow, refer to Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app guide.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

CarrierService
Requires shipping access scope.
A carrier service (also known as a carrier calculated service or shipping service) provides real-time shipping rates to Shopify. Some common carrier services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term carrier is often used interchangeably with the terms shipping company and rate provider.

Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on what is in the customer's cart.

Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource
To access the CarrierService resource, add the write_shipping permission to your app's requested scopes. For more information, see API access scopes.

Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements:

It's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.
It's on the Shopify plan with yearly billing, or the carrier service feature has been added to the store for a monthly fee. For more information, contact Shopify Support.
It's a development store.
Note
If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the requirements above.

Providing shipping rates to Shopify
When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint rooted in the callback_url property where Shopify can retrieve applicable shipping rates. The callback URL should be a public endpoint that expects these requests from Shopify.

A sample Shopify request for shipping rates:

POST
Your callback URL
Retrieves a list of applicable shipping rates

       }
   ]
}
                    
The address3, fax, address_type, and company_name fields are returned by specific ActiveShipping providers. For API-created carrier services, you should use only the following shipping address fields:

address1
address2
city
zip
province
country
Other values remain as null and are not sent to the callback URL.

Response fields
When Shopify requests shipping rates using your callback URL, the response object rates must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields. Required fields must be included in the response for the carrier service integration to work properly.

Field	Description
service_name
required	The name of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: Expedited Mail.
description
required	A description of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: Includes tracking and insurance.
service_code
required	A unique code associated with the rate. For example: expedited_mail.
currency
required	The currency of the shipping rate.
total_price
required	The total price expressed in subunits. If the currency doesn't use subunits, then the value must be multiplied by 100. For example: `"total_price": 500` for 5.00 CAD, `"total_price": 100000` for 1000 JPY.
phone_required	Whether the customer must provide a phone number at checkout.
min_delivery_date	The earliest delivery date for the displayed rate.
max_delivery_date	The latest delivery date for the displayed rate to still be valid.
Special conditions
To indicate that this carrier service cannot handle this shipping request, return an empty array and any successful (20x) HTTP code.
To force backup rates instead, return a 40x or 50x HTTP code with any content. A good choice is the regular 404 Not Found code.
Redirects (30x codes) will only be followed for the same domain as the original callback URL. Attempting to redirect to a different domain will trigger backup rates.
There is no retry mechanism. The response must be successful on the first try, within the time budget listed below. Timeouts or errors will trigger backup rates.
Response Timeouts
The read timeout for rate requests are dynamic, based on the number of requests per minute (RPM). These limits are applied to each shop-app pair. The timeout values are as follows.

RPM Range	Timeout
Under 1500	10s
1500 to 3000	5s
Over 3000	3s
Note: These values are upper limits and should not be interpretted as a goal to develop towards. Shopify is constantly evaluating the performance of the platform and working towards improving resilience as well as app capabilities. As such, these numbers may be adjusted outside of our normal versioning timelines.

Server-side caching of requests
Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of requests it makes. Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:

variant IDs
default shipping box weight and dimensions
variant quantities
carrier service ID
origin address
destination address
item weights and signatures
If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original request, then new shipping rates are requested. The cache expires 15 minutes after rates are successfully returned. If an error occurs, then the cache expires after 30 seconds.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

CarrierService
Requires shipping access scope.
A carrier service (also known as a carrier calculated service or shipping service) provides real-time shipping rates to Shopify. Some common carrier services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term carrier is often used interchangeably with the terms shipping company and rate provider.

Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on what is in the customer's cart.

Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource
To access the CarrierService resource, add the write_shipping permission to your app's requested scopes. For more information, see API access scopes.

Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements:

It's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.
It's on the Shopify plan with yearly billing, or the carrier service feature has been added to the store for a monthly fee. For more information, contact Shopify Support.
It's a development store.
Note
If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the requirements above.

Providing shipping rates to Shopify
When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint rooted in the callback_url property where Shopify can retrieve applicable shipping rates. The callback URL should be a public endpoint that expects these requests from Shopify.

A sample Shopify request for shipping rates:

POST
Your callback URL
Retrieves a list of applicable shipping rates

       }
   ]
}
                    
The address3, fax, address_type, and company_name fields are returned by specific ActiveShipping providers. For API-created carrier services, you should use only the following shipping address fields:

address1
address2
city
zip
province
country
Other values remain as null and are not sent to the callback URL.

Response fields
When Shopify requests shipping rates using your callback URL, the response object rates must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields. Required fields must be included in the response for the carrier service integration to work properly.

Field	Description
service_name
required	The name of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: Expedited Mail.
description
required	A description of the rate, which customers see at checkout. For example: Includes tracking and insurance.
service_code
required	A unique code associated with the rate. For example: expedited_mail.
currency
required	The currency of the shipping rate.
total_price
required	The total price expressed in subunits. If the currency doesn't use subunits, then the value must be multiplied by 100. For example: `"total_price": 500` for 5.00 CAD, `"total_price": 100000` for 1000 JPY.
phone_required	Whether the customer must provide a phone number at checkout.
min_delivery_date	The earliest delivery date for the displayed rate.
max_delivery_date	The latest delivery date for the displayed rate to still be valid.
Special conditions
To indicate that this carrier service cannot handle this shipping request, return an empty array and any successful (20x) HTTP code.
To force backup rates instead, return a 40x or 50x HTTP code with any content. A good choice is the regular 404 Not Found code.
Redirects (30x codes) will only be followed for the same domain as the original callback URL. Attempting to redirect to a different domain will trigger backup rates.
There is no retry mechanism. The response must be successful on the first try, within the time budget listed below. Timeouts or errors will trigger backup rates.
Response Timeouts
The read timeout for rate requests are dynamic, based on the number of requests per minute (RPM). These limits are applied to each shop-app pair. The timeout values are as follows.

RPM Range	Timeout
Under 1500	10s
1500 to 3000	5s
Over 3000	3s
Note: These values are upper limits and should not be interpretted as a goal to develop towards. Shopify is constantly evaluating the performance of the platform and working towards improving resilience as well as app capabilities. As such, these numbers may be adjusted outside of our normal versioning timelines.

Server-side caching of requests
Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of requests it makes. Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:

variant IDs
default shipping box weight and dimensions
variant quantities
carrier service ID
origin address
destination address
item weights and signatures
If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original request, then new shipping rates are requested. The cache expires 15 minutes after rates are successfully returned. If an error occurs, then the cache expires after 30 seconds.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

FulfillmentRequest
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
The FulfillmentRequest resource represents a fulfillment request made by the merchant or an order management app to a fulfillment service for a fulfillment order. A fulfillment service can accept or reject the fulfillment request.

Terminating a fulfillment request
A fulfillment service can stop fulfilling an accepted fulfillment request if they choose closing the fulfillment order as incomplete. The fulfillment order can be partially fulfilled when a fulfillment service chooses to stop the fulfillment.

The merchant or an order management app can notify the fulfillment service to cancel an accepted fulfillment request by sending a cancellation request. The fulfillment service can accept or reject the cancellation request. The fulfillment order can be partially fulfilled at this time.

The merchant or an order management app can also cancel a fulfillment order. Calling the cancel endpoint results in the fulfilment order being cancelled within Shopify. This change will not be communicated to the fulfilment service. If the intention is for a fulfilment service to halt fulfilment activity, a cancellation request should be sent to the fulfilment service instead, as described above.

Retrieving fulfillment request details
The FulfillmentOrder resource and the merchant_requests field can be used to retrieve the merchant requests which have been made. The overall status of these requests is also available using the request_status field of the fulfillment order.

To learn more about the fulfillment request process in the fulfillment workflow, refer to Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app guide.

REST Admin API
Choose a version:

2025-07 latest
2025-07latest

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

FulfillmentService
Requires fulfillments access scope.
A Fulfillment Service is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new FulfillmentService on a store, Shopify automatically creates a Location that's associated to the fulfillment service. To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app guide.

Using the FulfillmentService resource, you can register, edit, and delete a new fulfillment service.

Hosted endpoints
Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that Shopify can query on certain conditions. These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the callback_url parameter in the request that creates the fulfillment service.

Shopify sends POST requests to the callback_url/fulfillment_order_notification endpoint to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests.
As of the 2022-07 API version, it's mandatory for a fulfillment service to follow a fulfillment order based workflow by hosting the callback_url/fulfillment_order_notification endpoint, and acting on fulfillment requests and cancellations.
For more information, refer to Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations.
Shopify sends GET requests to the callback_url/fetch_tracking_numbers endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders if tracking_support is set to true.
For more information, refer to Enable tracking support.
Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with a corresponding API, rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
Shopify sends GET requests to the callback_url/fetch_stock endpoint to retrieve on hand inventory levels for the fulfillment service location if inventory_management is set to true.
For more information, refer to Sharing inventory levels with Shopify.
To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the callback_url-prefixed endpoints in your development store.

Resources and webhooks
There are a variety of REST resources and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work. To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the FulfillmentOrder, FulfillmentRequest, and CancellationRequest, Fulfillment and Order resources. To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side, besides awaiting calls to callback_url-prefixed endpoints, fulfillment services can subscribe to the fulfillment order and order webhooks.

Currency
Merchants who use Shopify Payments can allow customers to pay in their local currency on the online store. When a customer selects a currency, all prices on the online store and checkout are automatically converted to that currency. Merchants enable the currencies that they want to offer to customers from their Shopify Payments settings.

The Currency resource represents a currency that the merchant has enabled. For each enabled currency, the Currency resource returns the currency code and the time when its conversion rate was last updated.

The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the GraphQL Admin API. For details and migration steps, visit our migration guide.

Province
Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
Important
The REST Province API is deprecated as of version 2024-07.

Please refer to the documentation for each individual endpoint and the developer changelog for more information.

The Province resource represents the sales tax that's applied to orders based the sub-regions of a country. Sub-regions might include counties, emirates, governorates, prefectures, provinces, regions, states, and territories.


You can use the Province resource to retrieve and update available sub-regions for only the countries that a shop owner has added to a shipping zone. Merchants add countries to a shipping zone from the Shipping page of their Shopify admin.

For information on accessing the tax information for an entire country, including its provinces, see the Country resource.

Caution
As of version 2020-10, you can no longer update custom tax values for the Province resource.

A harmonized tax is a combination of provincial and federal sales taxes.

Normal and harmonized tax rates are applied to the pre-tax value of an order, but a compounded tax rate is applied on top of other tax rates. For example, if a $100 order receives a 5% normal tax rate and a 2% compound tax rate, then the post-tax total is $107.10 ((100 x 1.05) x 1.02 = 107.1).

tax_percentage
The province's tax in percent format.

ShippingZone
You can use the ShippingZone resource to view shipping zones and their countries, provinces, and shipping rates. A shipping zone belongs to a delivery profile, which provides shops with the ability to create shipping rates per product variant and per location. For example, the merchant might want to use a shipping rate that applies only to fragile products. When querying the ShippingZone resource, each shipping zone is returned with its corresponding profile ID, location group ID, and countries. Its possible for the same country to exist in multiple shipping zones, if the shipping zones with overlapping countries have different delivery profiles.
